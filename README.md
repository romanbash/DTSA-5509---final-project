# DTSA-5509---final-project
### In the project, we will try to predict strokes by using data that can be easily measured and obtained from the sample participants. The problem (the goal of this exercise) we will try to solve is predicting in advance which patients have a greater chance of having a stroke. We aim to reduce this chance in advance through a healthier life span, preventive treatment, and closer follow-up. We will do this by analyzing stroke informationâ€”that is, we will solve the problem using supervised learning. In the research process, we will use Different algorithms are linear regression, isolation forest (unsupervised), random forest, and SVM. The task is of binary classification type - stroke or not stroke.
